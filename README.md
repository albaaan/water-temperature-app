# water-temperature-app (Cobalt)

## Archive of an old group project.

Motive of the (now outdated) app named Cobalt: Show water temperatures for bathing spots by using [MET's Frost API](https://havvarsel-frost.met.no/) to fetch information about locations and temperature observations. This app also has a function to bookmark your favorite locations / spots. According to Met's Frost website, the API is still a work under progress, and since the app has not been maintained as well, it's less likely for the app to function as it used to.

## How to run
This app was made with the IDE Android Studio. You can run the app by running an emulator through it or having an android phone and using it as a source to run the code.
